                            One day in your life you decided to expel yourself from the list of mediocres. You made a complete inventory of things that you are going to work on and started your mission towards a better life. Everything was going great and you were on your endeavour for a very long time, say around 3 days. After that you start losing hope because nothing was working, you were not able to properly follow whatever you decided. No results could be seen. Tired of which you sabotage your mission and continued the way you were.
                           <br><br> <em>"If you pull a spring and realease it, it will get back to its original shape. But if you pull a spring and keep it in that position for a long time, it will atain a new shape."</em>
                            <br><br>
                            The same is the case with a human brain. If you want a better life or want to procure anything in life, you need to keep following whatever you have decided. Start will be onerous but you don't have to lose hope, no matter how many times you fizzle. As mentioned earlier you brain is like a spring, you want to alter it's shape, it's properties. To change something like that you got to haul that spring and keep it likewise for a very long time so as to make it invariable. In your case streching the spring means to follow whatever you have decided. Change takes time, the most prevalent reason why people give up is because they want to see the result briskly. But destiny demands endeavour, sometimes you will have to work for years to bring that change. In his book "365 Days with Self-Discipline", Martin mentioned that
                            <em>in order to be a superlative basketball player you will have to practice for years, it cannot be done in 2 or 3 days or even in a week.</em>
                            The day you will remove your focus from the end result and make the process your cynosure, things will start changing and if you are true to your process and your efforts are bona fide, you will achieve whatever you are seeking for.
                            <br><br>
                            <em>"Patience and Persistence is the key."</em>
                            <br><br>
                            When I started my haul to change myself to be a better human. At the start it was very difficult. For the first 10 days I was still at the same predicament where I was earlier, nothing changed. But this time I was too commited to my promise to change for a better cause and to be a better human, as 2-3 more days passed I realised I was just focusing on the final outcome and was being frustated cause things were not the way I wanted them to. <em>I wanted to build a house. So I started with the bricks, after two rows of bricks were added I stepped back and had a look, it was no where close to a house. There was just a stack of bricks one over the other. I was very dissappointed. Soon I realised that there was a lens of expectation environing my eyes, when I eliminated that lens I saw that I was one step closer to building that house. Also I realised that I will get a result if I kept adding the bricks. It will take time but it will happen. </em>
                            <br><br>
                            So whenever next time you feel that the change is not happening or get dissappointed by not seeing the outcome, just take a deep breath, remove the lens of expectations and then observe the situtaion. Trust me, things will look far better and will prompt you to keep making the effort to <em>change for good</em>.
