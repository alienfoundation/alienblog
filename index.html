                            You know what I fear the most!
                            <b>"Change".</b> Like this single word has always been the reason of my pain, anger, depression
                            and most of the bad things that happen to me. I fear change a lot. Since the very start, I had
                            very few to none friends because I used to live in my own world, I never tried to come out of
                            my thoughts and see the real world. I was too scared to do so because my thoughts give me relief,
                            they always give me peace. I know that even if I come out of my thoughts and encounter the real
                            world, I can still go back anytime. But I don't wanted to change things. Everything was very
                            smooth this way. I don't wanted to get that pain to deal with the society and the people around
                            me. So I always chose to be alone.
                            <br>This was just one example how fear of change always stopped me from doing anything, even if it
                            was for my good. It used to get hurt, I was dying inside each and every single day but my fear stopped
                            me from changing and with time I got used to it.
                            <br>
                            <br> When I entered college, I thought that this time I will change the way I live, I will try to
                            be a better person, a good friend, a good student etc. The start was good, but again the fear
                            appeared that people will leave me because I think a lot different, because I am too weak to
                            trust myself, because my thoughts are not congruent with the world etc. and always used to think
                            that no one will understand why I was this way. No one ever did. But I forgot that people understand
                            what I make them understand, people see what I show them, people act on how I act with them.
                            The thought that the world will understand me without me speaking to anyone was shit. I got to
                            take the initiative, if I wanted someone then I will have to show them. Just telling them and
                            thinking that they will understand is not going to work. The world works very differently than
                            what I used to think. I need to be in the system to understand the system. My thoughts can't
                            change the system until I take actions. But again, taking actions give pain, and I was too comfortable
                            in my thoughts to take that pain and change to fit in this society. But now or later, life teachs
                            everyone that you will have to fit in the society to survive, harsh but true. Either you
                            <em>"accept the life the way it is and take actions to make it the way you want"</em>, or
                            <em>"just sit and think of the life you want"</em>. Choice is all yours but the later will do nothing
                            except destroying you one day.
                            <br>
                            <br> I used to think that I will lose my identity in the process of being better, in the process
                            of changing myself for good. But life taught me that changing is not about losing you identity,
                            changing is not about walking in someone elseâ€™s shoes instead change is all about you being more
                            better, more stronger and more confident about your thoughts and the way you see the world. Change
                            is about trusting yourself, change is about making your thoughts more positive, change is about
                            trusting the people around you that they will not leave if I have trust on myself that I will
                            never push them because I am too scared of losing them.
                            <br>
                            <br> Fear will always push away the life that you want, it will always come into the way which leads
                            to happiness. Change is the bridge between who you are and who you wanna be, change is the path
                            to a better life, change is something you do when you know that you are killing yourself everyday
                            by being the same. If you think you are not happy with your life, sit and talk to yourself and
                            see what things are making you sad, if something is wrong then find why it is wrong and fix it
                            and to do so you will have to change your habits. You deserve to live a happy life, don't screw
                            up your life just because you are too scared to change.
