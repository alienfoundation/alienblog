                            Starting to change is not that easy. For example, I decided not to eat junk food or any outside unhealthy food. For 3 days everything was going great, but then I ate momos. I thought that it's ok, from now on I will not eat anything unhealthy. The very next day I went to the shop and bought some chips. It was 2 days back to back. Then I thought, it's been 2 successive days that I am being distracted from my decision and told myself that it was the last time. But again I ate something and this continued. Changing your habits and sticking to your decision at start is a gruelling task. You will break the laws you created for yourself and then you will be crestfallen due to the fact that you were unable to defy your temptation. <br>
                            <br>
                            Your mind will invariably tell you to leave your decision as you were unable to stop yourself and got distracted. But you can take it as a challenge that your past doesn't define you and you can again get back to before you were distracted. The question is how to stop distractions from distracting you? The answer is simple <em>distract your distractions.</em> For example, you decided that you will not drink carbonated drinks. You went to your fridge to drink water and saw a fresh cold bottle of coke kept in front of you. All you have to do is to simply take your eyes off the coke, drink water and shut the fridge door. It just takes a couple of seconds to distract your distractions and stop yourself from breaking the laws (and vice-versa).

                            <em>"Say you started to climb a mountain. It's a 7000ft high journey. You reached 40ft above the ground and saw an elegant flower. You know that 7000ft above resides an exquisite view still the biggest game played by our mind is that it can distract you with the modest things neglecting the future that holds the big. The flower was so beautiful that you cannot resist yourself from heading towards it. Deep inside you know that you ought to climb, but you want that flower also. Again comes that big law breaking moment and since your mind is habituated to neglect the big upcoming just for the small buzz in life, you decided to go towards that flower. You got that flower and was relished. While you were enjoying the juncture, your legs sliped and you fell down to zero. You learned that it was a mistake getting distracted with the small thing and leaving your path. Now most folks will think they tried, reached 40ft and slipped so there's no point in climbing the mountain. The truth is, they got distracted on their path, and they should take it as a lesson and start again but this time not to run for the small buzz, but to follow the path ahead. And when you see that flower again, you just have to distract your mind from it and pursue your mission. As soon as you will reach 41ft above the ground, you won't even return 1ft back to take that flower. And that's how it works, just a second between breaking the laws or to desist yourself from doing the same."</em>

                            Even today I still endeavour to stop myself from being distracted. You are trying to change the wiring of your brain which had been building there since the birth. To do that you will have to discern its wiring, then step by step it will lead you to the path. After that all that matters is how you follow your path. When things distract me, I remind my self these 12 words:
                            <br><br>
                            <em>"It just take couple of seconds to stop yourself from being distracted."</em>
                            <br><br>
                            It's all in your hands how you govern your mind and how you shape your life. No doubt is hard, but it is possible. I have tried and seen results. You are not here to go for the flower at 40ft, but to discover and feel how tempting it is going to be like when you will be at 7000ft. How things going to look, what life will be like. Settling for something just because you want instant gratification is nothing but your mind trying to fool you. It's all inside you and you only have to teach your mind that you are here not to settle with life but to live your life that you deserve.
