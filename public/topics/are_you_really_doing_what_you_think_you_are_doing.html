                            There’s a huge difference between things that you do and things that you think you are doing. Confused! Let me make it clear
                            by giving you the example on how I realised this. I made an inventory of do's and don'ts and
                            I was working according. But still there were times when I used to get frustrated and sad. Things
                            start to fall apart again. There was something wrong, something which was missing. My actions
                            were different but the thought process was the same. It was just that I learned how to control
                            my actions but deep down somewhere I was still confined to the typically thought, which was continously
                            bothering me. What I learned is that
                            <em>my thoughts and my actions were in great contrast</em>. I was so convinced by my actions of going
                            towards positivity that I forgot, pretending as positive from outside won't change my thought
                            that were still adamant inside.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <em>"Your thoughts must synchronise you actions."</em>
                            <br>
                            <br>Living a fake life can never lead you to be a better person. I don’t mean that you are living
                            a fake life, but in the process of becoming better you try probabily every possible way you could,
                            but your thoughts still remains the same. This is not going to make you better instead you will
                            end up being more broken. You are trying to hack life and control one of the most powerful things,
                            "your brain”. Doing so requires you to completely analyse yourself and the best way to do so
                            is talking to yourself, it always works. Believe me, somewhere inside you lies the solution,
                            you just don’t want to accept that. We as a human have a tendency to believe and act on others
                            advices but we neglect the calls our inner voice is making.

                            <br>
                            <br> To make it more clear, let us take one more example - You wanted to be more patient in hard
                            situations. It was summer and temperature was burning hot. You decided that you will use your
                            bike instead of car to go to the office. First two days went well; third day you were on your
                            way to the office, exhausted and irritated due to the hot weather and you were thinking - “If
                            I were in my car, there would be AC and all sorts of comfort...”. Your action meant that
                            <em>you were doing something to test your patience which inturn makes you more comfortable in hard
                                situations</em>, but thoughts implies something else. This is what I meant by telling that
                            you think you were doing right but actually you were not.

                            <br>
                            <br> All I want to say is that if you want real change and positivity in life, not just control you
                            actions but also control your thoughts. You will eventually end up being what you think instead
                            what you show.
