                                There are moments when you keep asking that why this is happening to me, what I have done wrong, why I can’t have a peaceful normal life and thousands more. These question just keep scrambling your mind but you do not get any answer.
                                <br><br>
                                I know you would have encountered this plenty of time in your life and I also know that after sometime everything would have fixed. So when you know that things are going to be fixed then why do we get so scared of the problems, why we can’t see the good that it brings with it, why can’t we see that these so called problems are here just to build you and make you stronger. It is because our mind had been conditioned this way since our birth. Have you every heard your parents telling you that <em>you have to study to learn something and eventually you will do great in exams.</em> No. You would have heard <em>if you don’t study, you will fail.</em> We have been constantly sown in our mind that challenges and problems are negative things.  Instead when you encounter a problem you should find the good in it. Yes, it is easy said then done. And in the beginning it is very hard. But once you develop this habit, no problem will be that big and also it will help you solve it with more power. Most of the times we even know the solution and we can see it, but we don’t want to believe it. As I mentioned earlier we are conditioned to see problems negatively. 
                                <br><br>
                                I know some situation are not in your control. For example, you were preparing for an interview and day before the interview you get hospitalised due to some reason. And you missed the interview. Here you getting ill was not in your control. Now you can sit and cry that why this happened to me or find the solution choice is all yours. I can just show you the different paths, I can also tell you which is wrong and which is right but to follow is your choice. <br>
                                <br>
                                Today one of my best friend left Delhi for his higher studies. I wanted him to stay in Delhi, I don’t want him to go. But I can not do anything here. He has to go for his studies. Now I could have sit and cry and thinking why he is going, why can’t he stay in Delhi. But if I think clearly I can see the positive side that he is going to make his future. He is going to learn there, to follow his dreams. And soon we are going to meet when he will be having holidays. 
                                
                                <br><br>There is always two side to each situation:<br>
                                1. See the negative only and sit and cry.<br>
                                2. See the good in it and think of the best you can do to make it more better.
